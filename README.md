# LSTM_Emotion
Use LSTM NN to extract alpha information from stocks

This is my undergraduate dissertation, currently, I am re-organizing the codes

In my disseration, I did the emotion classification by myself



Current LSTM version NN is based upon the data posed by [Gabriele Ranco](http://kt.ijs.si/data/Twitter_sentiment_DJIA30/) in their paper (The Effects of Twitter Sentiment on Stock Price Returns)[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.02431.pdf]
